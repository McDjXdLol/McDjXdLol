ðŸŽ® **What I do:**  
Making things in Python, and a little bit of HTML mixed with JavaScript and a little bit of CSS.  
By day, an office ninja, but in my head, Iâ€™m crafting epic quests and boss fights.  
ðŸ”¥ Plans? To build apps that sometimes even start on the first try ðŸ˜Ž

### After hours:  
- Playing games (ye that's shocking)
- Dreaming that bugs fix themselves (spoiler: they donâ€™t)  
- Putting off work and sometimes failing at it â€” but hey, who doesnâ€™t?

GitHub is my playground for fun, learning, and creating (sometimes I rage-quit, but always come back).  
Ready for the mission? ðŸš€
